##
# For a given user, find out which are the movies with
# the highes pagerank. It's a traversal that begins at
# a user node and first traverses through his like edges.
# From there it countinues through actings and directings.
#
# Imagine a user likes Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and
# The Dark Knight. Also, he likes two actors from Fear and
# Loathing in Las Vegas. The Dark Knight would have a lower
# rank than F&L, because it only has one inbound connection
# in the user's personal like graph. 
#
# To spice things up, we have added a minimum weight of 0.5.
# Only those actings and directings edges with a weight of 0.5
# or larger are traversed. This parameter is optional.
#
# This resource is paginated, feel free to use the per_page
# and page parameters (both optional)

# Wait a minute. What if we want to use this to suggest stuff
# to the user? Simple, just exclude like edges using the
# `exclude=likes` parameter (you can exclude every edge type,
# if the type does not exist, nothing will be excluded).
